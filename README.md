# astar

Contains implementations of Forward A\*, Backward\* and Adaptive\*, as well as three different tie-breaking strategies for equivalent f-values in the open list (by larger g-value, by smaller g-value and random). Algorithms are tested on pathfinding performance on randomly-generated (using depth-first search) 101x101 grids. Heuristic values are calculated using Manhattan Distance for Forward and Backward A\*. Run main.py for a demonstration.
